# ExampleEngine
This is an engine made using DirectX and C++.

The goal of the engine is to provide a very simple demonstration of 2D graphics in Direct3D. The solution is composed of two projects: 
the engine itself and the game project which only contains the entry point. The engine supports 2D rendering as well as 2D rotation on simple geometry.
